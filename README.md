# causalReg: Integrating Regression-based Causal Inference Tools for Empirical Research

[![build-status](https://github.com/chen-junluo/causalReg/actions/workflows/publish-proposal.yaml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/chen-junluo/causalReg/actions/workflows/publish-proposal.yaml)

## Project Overview

The `causalReg` package provides an integrated toolkit for regression-based causal inference methods in R, specifically designed to facilitate adoption by China's empirical research community. The package addresses three key aspects of causal inference:

1. **Sensitivity Analysis** - Implementation of Oster's method for assessing robustness to omitted variable bias
2. **Heterogeneous Treatment Effects** - Enhanced and fixed implementation of the SortedEffects methodology
3. **Policy Learning** - Tools for optimal treatment targeting and deployment

This project aims to create a bridge between Stata-centric workflows common in China's academic community and R's powerful ecosystem, enabling researchers to leverage cutting-edge causal inference techniques.

## Example: Oster Sensitivity Analysis

The `osterReg` function implements Oster's (2019) method for evaluating omitted variable bias:

```r
library(causalReg)

# Example data
data <- data.frame(
  y = rnorm(100),
  x = rnorm(100),
  z = rnorm(100),
  cluster = rep(1:10, each = 10)
)

# Run Oster regression
result <- osterReg(
  reg_type = "felm",
  depvar = "y",
  indepvar = "x",
  controls = c("z"),
  fixed_effects = c("cluster"),
  cluster_var = "cluster",
  data = data
)

print(result)
```

This analysis helps researchers understand how sensitive their causal estimates are to potential unmeasured confounders - a critical capability for robust empirical work that has been difficult to implement with multi-way fixed effects in existing tools.

## Project Motivation

In China, empirical researchers primarily use Stata for econometric analysis, especially for causal inference techniques like two-way fixed effects and difference-in-differences models. However, R offers significant advantages:

- Faster implementation of methodological innovations
- Superior visualization capabilities
- Open-source collaborative development
- Better support for reproducible research

`causalReg` aims to lower the barriers to R adoption by providing familiar causal inference tools with enhanced capabilities and bilingual documentation.

## Project Timeline

The package will be developed in three phases over 6-7 months:

1. **Phase 1 (2 months)**: Omitted Variable Bias Sensitivity Analysis
2. **Phase 2 (2 months)**: Treatment Effect Heterogeneity Analysis
3. **Phase 3 (2 months)**: Policy Learning Implementation
4. **Documentation & Release (1 month)**: Final integration and comprehensive documentation

## Team

The project is led by Dylan Junluo CHEN (PhD student, City University of Hong Kong), with support from:
- **Bofei SHE** (PhD student, NUS College of Computing)
- **Prof. Ben LIU** (City University of Hong Kong)
- **Prof. Xin LI** (City University of Hong Kong)
