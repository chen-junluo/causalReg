# Problem Definition

## What the problem is, and Who it affects

R stands as a premier platform for empirical research due to its widespread adoption among economists and statisticians, robust statistical testing capabilities that support rigorous empirical work, and a thriving open-source community ideal for reproducible research. Despite these advantages, significant gaps persist:

For Chinese students and researchers:
1. Substantial language barriers limit access to predominantly English documentation
2. Absence of Chinese-language communities for support and knowledge sharing
3. Lack of integrated frameworks and educational materials in Chinese that connect theoretical concepts with practical implementation

For the international research community: While emerging empirical methods appear in various packages, they lack integration into a cohesive framework, forcing researchers to navigate multiple disconnected tools and creating inefficiencies in the empirical workflow.

Our proposal aims to establish an integrated regression-based causality development toolkit, alongside a dedicated Chinese-language support organization, community platform, and comprehensive educational materials. This approach addresses both technical and accessibility challenges in the empirical research workflow.

## Have there been previous attempts to resolve the problem

As our Minimum Viable Product (MVP), we've selected one specific function for each of the three stages of causal inference:

1. **Omitted variable bias sensitivity analysis**[@oster2019unobservable]: The most comprehensive implementation is Stata's psacalc2 (https://github.com/ArthurHowardMorris/psacalc_supports_reghdfe). While it extends traditional psacalc with support for multiple fixed effects, it remains an unofficial patch that's cumbersome to use and lacks an R implementation.

2. **Heterogeneous treatment effect estimation**[@chernozhukov2018sorted]: The SortedEffects R package (https://cran.r-project.org/package=SortedEffects) currently leads in this area. However, it doesn't support continuous variables as predictors, severely limiting its applications. Additionally, the author appears to have left academia and doesn't respond to emails.

3. **Policy learning tools**[@athey2021policy]: While several implementations exist, such as policytree (https://github.com/grf-labs/policytree), they lack systematic Chinese-language tutorials and dissemination resources.

## Why it should be tackled

This project directly aligns with ISC's mission to support open source infrastructure by:

1. **Expanding the R ecosystem's accessibility** - Creating bilingual tools and resources will significantly broaden R's reach within China's growing research community
  
2. **Strengthening research infrastructure** - An integrated empirical toolkit will provide essential infrastructure for producing reliable, reproducible research findings

By addressing these specific needs, our project will strengthen both the R ecosystem and the broader open source research infrastructure, creating lasting impact on empirical research practices in China and beyond.
