# The Problem

In quantitative empirical research within China's academic community, Stata has long dominated as the primary tool for econometric analysis, particularly for causal inference techniques such as two-way fixed effects models and various difference-in-differences (DID) implementations [@angrist2009mostly]. This creates several critical challenges:

## Limited Methodological Access

While Stata offers established packages for traditional econometric approaches, newer methodologies often appear first in R. This creates a significant gap for Chinese research students who rely primarily on Stata. For example, recent developments in:

1. **Omitted variable bias sensitivity analysis** [@oster2019unobservable] - While implemented in Stata, current implementations don't fully support multiple fixed effects structures common in modern empirical work.

2. **Heterogeneous treatment effect estimation** - The SortedEffects package in R [@chernozhukov2018sorted] exhibits critical bugs with continuous variables that prevent proper analysis, yet remains unmaintained.

3. **Optimal policy learning** - Tools for determining which samples should receive which treatments to maximize effectiveness remain fragmented and inaccessible to non-specialists.

## Technical Barriers to Adoption

For many Chinese research students, transitioning from Stata to R presents significant challenges:

1. Language barriers limit access to English-language tutorials and documentation
2. Lack of integrated teaching materials specifically targeting econometric applications
3. Absence of comprehensive Chinese-language support for implementing causal inference methods in R

## Previous Attempts and Limitations

Several R packages individually address specific causal inference techniques, but they lack:

1. **Integration** - No single package consolidates regression-based causal inference methods
2. **Accessibility** - Limited bilingual documentation targeting Chinese users
3. **Maintenance** - Critical bugs in packages like SortedEffects remain unaddressed
4. **Pedagogy** - Missing connection to the applied econometrics workflow familiar to Stata users

## Why This Problem Matters

This situation creates a significant opportunity cost for China's empirical research community:

1. **Research quality** - Limited access to cutting-edge methods affects the rigor of empirical work
2. **Methodological innovation** - Restricted adoption of newer approaches hampers methodological advancement
3. **Research efficiency** - Working around tool limitations consumes valuable research time
4. **Global collaboration** - The divergence in tooling creates barriers to international research partnerships

The R ecosystem offers substantial advantages for causal inference with its open-source nature, reproducibility, visualization capabilities, and rapid integration of methodological innovations. Creating a bridge between this ecosystem and China's research community would significantly advance empirical research capabilities.
