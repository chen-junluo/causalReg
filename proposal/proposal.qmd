# The proposal

## Overview

The causalReg package will provide an integrated toolkit for regression-based causal inference methods in R, specifically designed to facilitate adoption by China's empirical research community. By addressing the methodological gaps identified in the problem statement, causalReg will:

1. **Integrate critical causal inference techniques** into a cohesive framework built on established R packages like lfe [@gaure2013lfe]
2. **Provide bilingual documentation and tutorials** targeting Chinese research students
3. **Establish ongoing maintenance** for key capabilities including SortedEffects
4. **Create a bridge** between Stata-centric workflows and R's powerful ecosystem

This project directly aligns with the R Consortium's mission by expanding R's reach in a significant academic community, ensuring package sustainability, and promoting reproducible research practices.

## Detail

The causalReg package will be developed in three progressive phases, each targeting a key component of the regression-based causal inference workflow:

### Phase 1: Omitted Variable Bias Sensitivity Analysis

Building on the methodology developed by Oster [-@oster2019unobservable], we will implement a robust solution for sensitivity analysis that:

- Extends existing implementations to support multi-way fixed effects through integration with the lfe package
- Provides intuitive visualization of sensitivity bounds
- Includes comprehensive documentation with applied examples from economics and information systems

The implementation will handle both continuous and binary outcomes, with full support for the standard econometric workflow including clustered standard errors and various fixed effects specifications.

### Phase 2: Treatment Effect Heterogeneity Analysis

We will revive and enhance the SortedEffects package [@chernozhukov2018sorted] to:

- Fix critical bugs affecting continuous variable analysis
- Improve integration with standard regression workflows
- Add robust visualization capabilities for heterogeneous effects
- Enhance documentation with practical examples 

This module will allow researchers to move beyond average treatment effects to understand how causal impacts vary across the population - a critical capability for policy analysis.

### Phase 3: Policy Learning Implementation

Building on recent methodological developments in machine learning for causal inference [@athey2021policy], we will:

- Implement methods for optimal treatment targeting
- Provide tools to estimate heterogeneous treatment effects with machine learning
- Create accessible interfaces for policy learning without requiring deep ML expertise
- Develop step-by-step tutorials for applied policy analysis

### Minimum Viable Product

The MVP for causalReg will include:

1. A functioning R package with robust implementations of Oster sensitivity analysis and SortedEffects
2. Comprehensive bilingual documentation including:
   - Function references
   - Methodological vignettes
   - Applied tutorials with real-world datasets
3. Integration with existing R econometric workflows
4. Initial educational materials for Chinese users

### Architecture

The package will be built with a modular design that:

1. Leverages established packages (lfe, sandwich, ggplot2) for core functionality
2. Provides consistent syntax across different causal inference methods
3. Includes flexible visualization components
4. Offers both high-level interface functions and access to underlying components

This architecture ensures maintainability while allowing advanced users to customize analyses as needed.

### Assumptions

Our approach is built on several key assumptions:

1. The primary barrier to R adoption among Chinese research students is the lack of integrated, well-documented causal inference tools
2. The proposed methodologies represent the most pressing needs for this community
3. Bilingual materials will significantly reduce adoption barriers
4. The integration of these methods will provide sufficient value to motivate users to transition from Stata
