# Requirements

## People

### Core Team

The project requires a small, focused team with expertise in both econometrics and R programming:

- **Dylan Junluo CHEN** (PhD student, City University of Hong Kong, Department of Information Systems): Project lead with experience in empirical research methods and R package development
- **Bofei SHE** (PhD student, National University of Singapore, College of Computing): Programming expertise and econometric knowledge

Additional support will come from two professors and PhD colleagues at CityU with experience in R programming and empirical research who have expressed interest in contributing to open-source projects.

### Roles and Responsibilities

- **Dylan Junluo CHEN**: Project management, core development, documentation, community engagement
- **Bofei SHE**: Development support, code review, testing
- **Prof. Ben LIU**: Econometric methodology consultation
- **Prof. Xin LI**: Machine learning methodology consultation

## Processes

The project will implement GitHub-based development with branch protection, continuous integration testing, and documentation requirements for all new features. Communication will occur through bi-weekly team meetings, with monthly progress updates to ISC.

## Tools & Tech

The project will utilize established R packages (lfe, ggplot2, sandwich, glmnet, tidyverse) as dependencies, with GitHub for code hosting, CRAN for distribution, and GitHub Pages for documentation.

## Funding

The requested funding of $1,000 will be allocated as follows:

1. **Educational Materials ($300)**:
   - Video tutorial production
   - Example dataset preparation
   - Translation services for documentation

2. **Community Building ($300)**:
   - Virtual workshop hosting
   - WeChat official account maintenance
   - User community support

3. **Contingency ($400)**:
   - Reserved for unexpected requirements

## Summary

This project requires a focused development team with expertise in both econometrics and R programming, supported by academic advisors with domain knowledge. The technical requirements are modest, primarily relying on existing R infrastructure and packages. The funding requested will primarily support dedicated development time to ensure timely completion of all components and the creation of high-quality educational materials necessary for adoption by the target user community.
