# Success

## Definition of done

The causalReg project will be considered complete when:

1. A fully functional R package is published on CRAN containing all three modules:
   - Omitted variable bias sensitivity analysis
   - Treatment effect heterogeneity analysis
   - Policy learning implementation

2. Comprehensive bilingual documentation is available including:
   - Complete function reference (English and Chinese)
   - Methodological vignettes explaining the underlying theory
   - Applied tutorials with real-world examples
   - Video tutorials covering key workflows

3. A sustainable community structure is established:
   - Active WeChat group for Chinese users
   - Responsive GitHub issue process
   - Clear contribution guidelines for future development

4. Educational materials are available:
   - Workshop materials for university courses
   - Self-paced learning resources
   - Example datasets with complete workflows

## Measuring success

We will track project success through several quantifiable metrics:

**Short-term metrics (1 year)**:
- GitHub repository: 100+ stars
- CRAN downloads: 1,000+ in first year
- WeChat articles: 5+ with 1,000+ views each
- Video tutorials: 5+ with 500+ views each
- Community size: 100+ members in WeChat group
- Issue resolution: 90% of reported bugs resolved within 2 weeks

**Medium-term metrics (2 years)**:
- Academic citations: 5+ papers using the package
- Educational adoption: 3+ university courses using the materials
- Package extensions: 2+ external contributions merged
- CRAN downloads: 5,000+ cumulative

**Qualitative success indicators**:
- Positive feedback from Chinese research students
- Reduction in reported barriers to R adoption
- Examples of research using methods previously inaccessible

## Future work

This project lays the foundation for several future extensions:

1. **Additional methodologies**:
   - Synthetic control methods
   - Instrumental variable approaches
   - Regression discontinuity designs
   - Machine learning-based causal inference techniques

2. **Integration with other ecosystems**:
   - Interoperability with Python tools like DoWhy
   - Connections to Bayesian frameworks
   - Integration with tidymodels ecosystem

3. **Educational expansion**:
   - Full online course development
   - Textbook companion materials
   - Integration with university curricula

4. **Community development**:
   - Annual contributor workshops
   - Regional user groups in major Chinese cities
   - Regular webinar series featuring applied case studies

## Key risks

### People

**Risk**: Limited availability of core team members due to academic commitments
**Mitigation**: Clear time allocation agreements, modular development allowing parallel work, comprehensive documentation to facilitate onboarding additional contributors

**Risk**: Difficulty finding contributors with both econometric and R expertise
**Mitigation**: Focused recruitment efforts in academic communities, development of contributor guides that separate technical and methodological tasks

### Processes

**Risk**: Challenges in maintaining bilingual documentation synchronization
**Mitigation**: Establish clear translation workflow, prioritize function documentation and core vignettes, leverage community for translation assistance

**Risk**: Scope creep as additional methodologies are requested
**Mitigation**: Maintain strict prioritization process, establish clear criteria for inclusion in core package versus extensions

### Tooling & Technology

**Risk**: Compatibility issues with future R versions
**Mitigation**: Implement comprehensive continuous integration testing, monitor R-devel changes, establish deprecation policies for API changes

**Risk**: Dependency on lfe package maintenance
**Mitigation**: Document key dependencies, establish contingency for potential forking if necessary, maintain communication with upstream package maintainers

### Costs

**Risk**: Underestimation of development time requirements
**Mitigation**: Phase-based approach allows for reassessment at milestone points, prioritization of core functionality first

**Risk**: Unexpected costs for community building and outreach
**Mitigation**: Leverage existing academic networks, utilize free platforms where possible, allocate contingency funds
